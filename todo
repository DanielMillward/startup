Add other user box in new game maker - DONE
if not one of the users, disable all boxes forever
add hash of each player's cards to url as first move
add current betting round and whose turn it is also? and number of hands played so far
also add actions taken that round so far, start as empty array
based on that info, see what moves are allowed, enable those boxes
if not your turn, disable all boxes
if (terminal condition of hand), then display new round?
